# A-WPTAS Privacy Policy

## Background

The A-WPTAS app has been created by Prof. A. Shores of Macquarie University as a
guide to the implementation of the A-WPTAS test for Post Traumatic Amnesia. The
app guides a medical professional through administration of the test and stores
the result. 

## No Personal Information is Collected

The app does not collect or store any personal information about the user or the
patient being tested.   A name (identifier) and location is entered for each 
patient but this is only stored on the device and never transmitted to any online service.
The medical practicioner is responsible for the privacy of the data on their 
device.
